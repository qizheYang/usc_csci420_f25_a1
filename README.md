This is a repo for CSCI 420 Assignment 1: Height Map.

This homework is on writing a basic OpenGL program using C++ to accept black and white input from an image and have it displayed in vertices/lines/triangles in a window.

This repo is public to everyone learning Computer Graphics. As a beginner in this area, I'm happy if you are helped with my work.
