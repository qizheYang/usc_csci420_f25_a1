# Core Functions Implemented

Mode 1, 2, 3 for vertices (points), lines and triangles.

Mode 4 for smoothened with keyboard input to change scale/exponent.

Mouse input to rotate, translate and scale.

Grayscale coloring.

# Additional Features

Keyboard input to manipulate: WASD to move around, QE to turn left and right, RF to see up and down, and ZC to zoom in and out. This is inspired by Cities: Skylines.

# Animation

A python script is included in animation_helper folder and running it automatically converts the screenshots of latest run into an animation of 15 fps for 20 seconds. Please go to ```~/usc_csci420_f25_a1/animation_helper``` to see.

It can handle up to 768x768 at least. Tested with 800x800 and failed.

### Render points, lines, triangles

As can be seen from running or animation.
